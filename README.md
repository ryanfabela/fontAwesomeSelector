# fontAwesomeSelector
This doc is a drop in component that will detect a press on a Font Awesome Icon and display a modal to search and change the icons. We use this for our customers in SurrealCMS allowing them to choose their own icon and publish it, saving it to the server. You might need to modify your website code to get it to work. We put the editable tag for the wrapping div around not just the icon, but the p and h1 tags as well.
